# The Buzz

1. Run npm install while inside the frontend folder
2. Run pip install while inside the backend folder
3. If missing some check js or python files if dependencies missing and pip install/npm install those
4. Run npm start to startup frontend (keep in mind which folder your terminal is in)
5. python server.py to startup backend
6. Api keys required for newsapi.py as well as aisummarization.py with newsapi just having a spot you can place the string. Also a postgres database url. All can be dropped into a .env file
7. After all this, you should be able to use the site

Good luck...
